		<h2>Original Text</h2>
		   The Great Merger Movement was a predominantly U.S. business 
phenomenon that happened from 1895 to 1905. During this time, small 
firms with little market share consolidated with similar firms to form 
large, powerful institutions that dominated their markets, such as the 
Standard Oil Company, which at its height controlled nearly 90% of the 
global oil refinery industry. It is estimated that more than 1,800 of 
these firms disappeared into consolidations, many of which acquired 
substantial shares of the markets in which they operated. The vehicle 
used were so-called trusts. In 1900 the value of firms acquired in 
mergers was 20% of GDP. In 1990 the value was only 3% and from 1998 to 
2000 it was around 10–11% of GDP. Companies such as DuPont, U.S. Steel, 
and General Electric that merged during the Great Merger Movement were 
able to keep their dominance in their respective sectors through 1929, 
and in some cases today, due to growing technological advances of their 
products, patents, and brand recognition by their customers. There were 
also other companies that held the greatest market share in 1905 but at 
the same time did not have the competitive advantages of the companies 
like DuPont and General Electric. These companies such as International 
Paper and American Chicle saw their market share decrease significantly 
by 1929 as smaller competitors joined forces with each other and 
provided much more competition.
